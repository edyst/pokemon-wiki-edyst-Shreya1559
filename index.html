          <p>Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers

                <p>Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                <p>Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

In the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves.

        <h2 class="h-q-ans">Q and A</h2>
        <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>
                What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</b>
            </li>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Answer is Raichu
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
            <li><b>
                What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?
                </b>
            </li>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Answer is Master Ball

                The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
                created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
                Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
                after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
                Green version was not released outside Japan
